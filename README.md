# ForgeSphere

ForgeSphere is a web-based, multi-chain wallet application designed to streamline wallet creation and management for Web3 users. Currently, it supports generating public-private key pairs for Solana and Ethereum wallets, making it easy to create and connect to secure wallets on these blockchains. 

In future releases, ForgeSphere will support token creation, beginning with Solana and potentially expanding to other blockchains for a versatile and fully-featured experience.

## Features

- **HD Wallet Generation**: Generate hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets using secure seed phrases, ensuring strong wallet security.
- **Multi-Chain Compatibility**: Currently supports wallet generation and management for both Solana and Ethereum blockchains.
- **Faucet Integration**: Easily connect to your generated wallet or a browser extension wallet to receive test tokens (SOL or ETH) from a faucet.

*Note: Token launch and management features are in development and will be available in future updates.*
